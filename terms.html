            <h2>5. Subscriptions & Payments</h2>

            <h3>5.1 Subscription Plans</h3>
            <p>
                We offer both free and paid subscription plans. Paid plans ("Pro") provide access to additional
                features and functionality. Details of current plans and pricing are available on our website and
                within the applications.
            </p>

            <h3>5.2 Payment Processing</h3>
            <p>Payments are processed differently depending on the platform you use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Web Application</strong> – Payments are processed by Stripe. By making a purchase, you
                    agree to <a href="https://stripe.com/legal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe's Terms of
                        Service</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>iOS Application</strong> – Payments are processed through Apple's In-App Purchase system.
                    Purchases are subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/"
                                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Terms and Conditions</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Android Application</strong> – Payments are processed through Google Play's billing system.
                    Purchases are subject to <a href="https://play.google.com/intl/en_uk/about/play-terms/"
                                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play's Terms of Service</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Our subscription management is powered by RevenueCat, which enables us to synchronise your subscription
                status across platforms.
            </p>

            <h3>5.3 Cross-Platform Access</h3>
            <p>
                A subscription purchased on one platform entitles you to Pro features across all platforms when logged
                into the same account. However, subscriptions themselves are managed by the platform where the original
                purchase was made.
            </p>
            <div class="highlight-box warning">
                <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> Pricing may vary between platforms due to platform fees and regional pricing.
                    The price displayed at the point of purchase is the price you will be charged.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>5.4 Automatic Renewal</h3>
            <p>
                Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period (monthly or annually) unless you
                cancel before the renewal date. You will be charged at the then-current rate for your subscription plan.
            </p>

            <h3>5.5 Cancellation</h3>
            <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Web</strong> – Through your account settings at app.myjobtrackr.com or via the Stripe
                    customer portal</li>
                <li><strong>iOS</strong> – Through your Apple ID account settings or the App Store</li>
                <li><strong>Android</strong> – Through Google Play Store subscription settings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period. You will retain access to Pro
                features until that date.
            </p>

            <h3>5.6 Refunds</h3>
            <p>Refund policies differ by platform:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Web (Stripe)</strong> – We may offer refunds on a case-by-case basis within 14 days of
                    purchase. Contact us to request a refund.</li>
                <li><strong>iOS</strong> – Refunds are handled exclusively by Apple. You must request refunds through
                    <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Report a
                        Problem</a> page.</li>
                <li><strong>Android</strong> – Refunds are handled by Google Play. You may request refunds through the
                    <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google
                        Play refund process</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We cannot process refunds for purchases made through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store directly.
            </p>

            <h3>5.7 Price Changes</h3>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to change subscription prices. For existing subscribers, price changes will take
                effect at the start of the next billing period following notice of the change. Continued use of the
                Service after a price change constitutes acceptance of the new price.
